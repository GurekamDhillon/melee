# Text-only comm callout

Shows Comms callouts (offline). Read `scripts/main.lua`; no external art or disc data is included.

Run on an offline vanilla LAB match on FD with P1 human and P2 CPU:
`load <absolute-path-to-this-folder>` in the console. Controls: C: queue a text callout with fallback portrait initial.
`unload demo_callouts` releases the demo. Use a fresh match between demos.
For native item/FX packages, mount this folder as a mod at boot (see the catalogue guide).

Watch the status caption for acceptance/refusal; gameplay writes are offline only.
